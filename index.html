		<h3>Addis Ababa Institute of Technology</h3>
	<p>
	I am Wasiun Dangura. I was born in Jan 1st of 1999 G.C at a small town
    near  Hawassa, the capital  of South Nations, and Nationalities (SNNP), 
    from my father Dangura Tontone, and Edilnesh Hailu. I'm the last child 
    of the  family. This  in turn helped  me to grow by gathering a lot of 
    experience  from my  older brothers, and sisters. It also  directed my 
    parents focus to be up on me. <br>
    I believe that everything is possible and any situation can be changed.
    I believe on God  almighty that's why I believe on possiblity. Current
    situation, and reality  may be a direct opposite of what I believe and
    hope for, but it  will be changed. Actually, reality  is almost always 
    against the vision of someone. Here is a saying, "A rever cuts through
    a rock  not because of its  strength, but because of its persistance."
